# Effulgence

An iOS app to test jailbreak detection libraries.

### Bastille

This is my own jailbreak detection library. Challenge: Try and bypass this without disabling the function.

## Installation

Sideload the app to your device using TrollStore or AltStore (or any other method). You can find the IPA [here](https://github.com/jjolano/EffulgenceDemo/releases/latest).
